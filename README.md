# openSpine
This is a placeholder for an open musculoskeletal spine model wirtten in Python (or Matlab)

With this project we like to address the limitations of OpenSim as mentioned here: [OpenSim docs](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Scripting)

> Limitations
> - In general, you cannot create new components (e.g., a custom muscle; though there are some exceptions).
> - You cannot create plugins for use through the GUI or command-line.
> - In Matlab/Python, thereâ€™s no access to OpenSim's plotter (use Matlab/Python native plotter) or visualizer (use the Simbody visualizer).
> - Many SimTK/Simbody classes (that belong to the SimTK namespace and simbody internals) are not available (e.g., integrators).
